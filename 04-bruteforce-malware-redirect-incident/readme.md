# Brute Force Compromise → Malware Download → Malicious Redirect (tcpdump Analysis)

## Overview
This project documents a security incident affecting yummyrecipesforme.com. A brute force attack compromised the admin account, malicious JavaScript was injected into the website, and visitors were prompted to download an executable that redirected them to a malicious domain.

## Evidence
- tcpdump traffic log showing DNS + HTTP activity
- DNS resolution for yummyrecipesforme.com followed by HTTP GET traffic
- Later DNS + HTTP traffic for greatrecipesforme.com confirming redirect behavior

## Protocols Observed
- DNS: domain name to IP address resolution
- HTTP: web page retrieval and file download requests

## Root Cause (Confirmed)
Admin credentials were compromised through a brute force attack using default passwords, and the attacker modified website source code to deliver malware and redirect users.

## Remediation Recommendation
Enable MFA and remove default credentials. Add rate limiting and account lockouts to prevent brute force attacks.
