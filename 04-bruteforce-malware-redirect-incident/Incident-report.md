# Security Incident Report

## Section 1: Identify the network protocol involved in the incident
DNS and HTTP are the primary protocols involved. DNS resolved yummyrecipesforme.com and greatrecipesforme.com to IP addresses, and HTTP was then used to request web content and initiate the malicious download and redirect.

## Section 2: Document the incident
The user’s browser first made a DNS request for yummyrecipesforme.com and received the correct IP address. The browser then established a TCP connection and sent an HTTP GET request to retrieve the webpage. After additional HTTP traffic, the browser later made a DNS request for greatrecipesforme.com and received a different IP address. The browser then established another TCP connection and sent an HTTP GET request to greatrecipesforme.com, confirming a redirect to a malicious site. Investigation confirmed the web server was compromised after a brute force attack on the admin account using default credentials, allowing the attacker to inject malicious JavaScript and force malware downloads and redirects.

## Section 3: Recommend one remediation for brute force attacks
Implement strong authentication controls by removing default credentials and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA). Add account lockout and rate limiting after repeated failed login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.
