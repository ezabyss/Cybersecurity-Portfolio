# Access Control Investigation & Mitigation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes an access control failure that led to an attempted fraudulent payroll transaction.  
By reviewing event logs and employee records, I identified weaknesses in authentication and authorization controls and proposed mitigations to prevent similar incidents.

## 🧩 Scenario
A growing business detected a payroll deposit attempt to an unknown bank account.  
The payment was stopped in time, and I was tasked with investigating the incident as the company’s first cybersecurity professional.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Analyze event logs to identify suspicious activity
- Cross-reference employee access records
- Identify access control weaknesses
- Recommend security improvements

## 🛡️ Security Concepts Demonstrated
- Authentication vs Authorization
- Least privilege
- Access control auditing
- Insider threat detection

## ✍️ Reflection
This exercise highlights how weak access controls and shared privileges can lead to serious financial risk.  
Strong role-based access, monitoring, and timely access revocation are critical to preventing insider misuse.
