# PASTA Threat Modeling – Sneaker Marketplace App

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies the **PASTA (Process of Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)** framework to evaluate the security risks of a mobile marketplace application designed for buying and selling sneakers.

The objective is to identify **business risks, technical threats, exploitable vulnerabilities, and security controls** *before* the application is released to production—demonstrating a proactive security mindset aligned with secure software development practices.

This assessment follows all **seven stages of the PASTA framework** and reflects real-world threat modeling workflows used by security engineering and application security teams.

## 🔍 Key Security Outcomes
- Identified **high-risk attack vectors** affecting user data and payments
- Mapped **threats to vulnerabilities** using an attack-tree approach
- Recommended **defense-in-depth security controls**
- Demonstrated **risk-based decision making** aligned with business goals

---

## 📚 Key Takeaways
- Threat modeling is most effective **before deployment**
- APIs and payment flows represent the **largest attack surface**
- Combining **technical controls + policy + user awareness** is critical
- PASTA enables security teams to think like attackers *and* defenders
