## 📌 Included Diagrams

### 1️⃣ Data Flow Diagram (`data-flow.png`)
This diagram illustrates a core application process where users search for sneakers that are listed for sale.

It highlights:
- How user requests interact with backend processes
- How data is retrieved from the database
- Key trust boundaries where sensitive data is processed

The diagram was used during **PASTA Stage III (Decompose the Application)** to analyze how information moves through the system and identify potential exposure points.

### 2️⃣ Attack Tree Diagram (`attack-tree.png`)
This diagram represents a simplified attack tree focused on compromising user data.

It highlights:
- High-level attacker goals (e.g., access to user data)
- Common attack vectors such as SQL injection and session hijacking
- Underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks

The attack tree was used during **PASTA Stage VI (Attack Modeling)** to visualize how threats and vulnerabilities combine into realistic attack paths.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- These diagrams are intentionally simplified for clarity and learning.
- Real-world applications typically require more detailed diagrams with multiple processes, trust boundaries, and data stores.
- The diagrams should be viewed as **analytical aids**, not exhaustive system designs.
