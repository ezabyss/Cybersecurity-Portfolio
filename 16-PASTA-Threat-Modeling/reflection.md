## 🔍 Reflection & Key Takeaways

This project helped me understand how structured threat modeling frameworks like PASTA guide security decision-making before an application is deployed. Instead of focusing only on technical vulnerabilities, I learned to start with business objectives and evaluate how security failures could impact users, trust, and regulatory compliance.

Working through the seven PASTA stages strengthened my attacker mindset by forcing me to think about how real threat actors could exploit application components such as APIs, authentication systems, and databases. Mapping threats and vulnerabilities to an attack tree made it easier to visualize attack paths and prioritize risks rather than treating all issues equally.

This exercise also reinforced the importance of preventative controls early in the development lifecycle. Implementing encryption, input validation, strong authentication, and logging at the design stage is significantly more effective than reacting after a breach. In a real organization, I would use this threat model to collaborate with developers, product managers, and leadership to reduce risk before launch.
