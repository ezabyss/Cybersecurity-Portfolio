# NIST SP 800-53: AC-6 — Least Privilege

## Overview
NIST Special Publication 800-53 is a security and privacy framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Control **AC-6 (Least Privilege)** is part of the Access Control (AC) family and focuses on limiting user access to the minimum level required to perform assigned tasks.

## What is Least Privilege?
The principle of least privilege requires that users, systems, and processes are granted **only the access necessary** to complete their job functions. This reduces the risk of accidental data exposure, misuse of permissions, and unauthorized access to sensitive information.

## Purpose of AC-6
AC-6 is designed to prevent users from operating with more privileges than needed. By enforcing strict access boundaries, organizations can minimize the impact of both malicious actions and unintentional mistakes.

## Key Control Elements
NIST SP 800-53: AC-6 emphasizes:
- Restricting access to sensitive resources based on user roles  
- Enforcing role-based access control (RBAC)  
- Automatically revoking access when it is no longer required  
- Logging user activity related to access  
- Regularly auditing user privileges  

## Why AC-6 is Important
Many data breaches occur due to **excessive permissions and human error**, not external attackers. AC-6 reduces the attack surface by ensuring that even if an account is compromised, the potential damage is limited.

## Practical Application
In collaborative environments such as sales meetings or partner engagements, AC-6 ensures that employees can access only approved files rather than entire folders. Time-limited access and restricted sharing settings help prevent accidental data leaks caused by link sharing or misconfiguration.

## Conclusion
NIST SP 800-53: AC-6 highlights that effective access control is critical for protecting sensitive data. Enforcing least privilege through technical, operational, and managerial controls strengthens information privacy and reduces organizational risk.
