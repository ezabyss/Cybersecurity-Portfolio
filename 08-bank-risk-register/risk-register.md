# Risk Register – Bank

## Step 1: Operating Environment Summary
The bank operates in a coastal area with low crime rates but is exposed to environmental risks such as storms. It employs 100 on-premise staff and 20 remote employees who access sensitive financial systems. The bank serves over 2,200 customers and operates under strict financial regulations, increasing the impact of any security incident.

## Step 2: Risk Factors (2–3 sentences)
Security events are possible due to human error, system vulnerabilities, and environmental factors. Employees may fall victim to phishing attacks, while weak encryption or misconfigured systems could expose financial data. Although crime rates are low, natural disasters and supply chain disruptions could still affect access to funds.

## Step 3: Risk Scoring Methodology
Risk scores were calculated using a qualitative risk matrix:

- **Likelihood**:  
  1 = Low, 2 = Moderate, 3 = High  
- **Severity**:  
  1 = Low, 2 = Moderate, 3 = High  

**Risk Score = Likelihood × Severity**

## Step 4: Completed Risk Register

| Asset | Risk | Description | Likelihood (1–3) | Severity (1–3) | Risk Score |
|------|------|------------|-----------------|---------------|------------|
| Funds | Business email compromise | An employee is tricked into sharing confidential information, enabling fraudulent transactions. | 2 | 2 | **4** |
| Funds | Compromised user database | Customer data is poorly encrypted, increasing the risk of unauthorized access. | 2 | 3 | **6** |
| Funds | Financial records leak | A backup database server is publicly accessible. | 3 | 3 | **9** |
| Funds | Theft | The bank’s safe is left unlocked. | 1 | 3 | **3** |
| Funds | Supply chain disruption | Delivery delays caused by natural disasters. | 1 | 2 | **2** |

## Step 5: Risk Prioritization
The financial records leak received the highest priority score because it combines high likelihood with severe impact, posing significant regulatory and operational risk. Compromised customer data also requires urgent attention due to compliance obligations. Physical theft and supply chain disruption are lower priorities because of low crime rates and infrequent environmental events.

## Key Takeaways
This risk register demonstrates how likelihood and severity scoring help organizations prioritize cybersecurity risks. By focusing on the highest-scoring risks first, security teams can allocate resources effectively and reduce overall business impact.
