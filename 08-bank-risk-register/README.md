## Overview
This project simulates a cybersecurity risk assessment for a bank. 
A risk register was created to evaluate threats to the bank’s funds by scoring likelihood and severity, calculating overall risk, and prioritizing remediation efforts.

## Objectives
- Identify key risks affecting bank funds
- Score risks using a qualitative risk matrix
- Prioritize risks based on likelihood and impact
- Apply structured risk assessment methodology

## Framework Alignment
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Identify → Risk Assessment)

## Files
- `risk_register.md` – Completed risk register with scoring and prioritization
