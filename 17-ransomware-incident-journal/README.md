# 🛡️ Ransomware Incident Response – Incident Handler’s Journal

## 📌 Project Overview
This project documents the analysis of a ransomware security incident using an **incident handler’s journal**. The goal is to demonstrate structured incident documentation, analytical thinking, and incident response fundamentals commonly used by security analysts and SOC teams.

The scenario is based on a real-world style healthcare ransomware attack and focuses on **how incidents are recorded, analyzed, and reflected on**, rather than hands-on malware execution.

## 📖 Scenario Summary
A small U.S. healthcare clinic experienced a ransomware attack on a Tuesday morning at approximately 9:00 a.m. Employees were unable to access critical systems, including patient medical records, causing an immediate shutdown of business operations.

The attackers gained initial access through **targeted phishing emails** that contained a malicious attachment. Once opened, ransomware was deployed, encrypting critical files. A ransom note demanded payment in exchange for a decryption key.
