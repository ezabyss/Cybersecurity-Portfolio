## 🔍 The 5 W’s of the Incident

### **Who caused the incident?**
An organized group of unethical hackers known to target healthcare and transportation organizations.

### **What happened?**
Attackers deployed ransomware that encrypted critical systems and files after gaining initial access through a phishing email containing a malicious attachment.

## 📌 Additional Notes & Reflections
- This incident highlights how **phishing remains one of the most effective initial access vectors**, especially in healthcare environments where staff operate under time pressure.
- A lack of security awareness training and insufficient email filtering likely contributed to the success of the attack.
- Defense-in-depth controls such as endpoint detection, attachment sandboxing, offline backups, and phishing simulations could have significantly reduced impact.
- Paying ransom presents ethical, legal, and operational risks and does not guarantee full data recovery.
- This scenario reinforced the importance of **early detection, user education, and clear incident escalation procedures**.

## 🎯 Key Takeaway
This exercise demonstrates that ransomware incidents are often driven by **social engineering and process gaps**, not just technical weaknesses. Effective incident response begins with disciplined documentation, enabling faster containment, informed decision-making, and long-term security improvements.
