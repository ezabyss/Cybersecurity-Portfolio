# Cybersecurity Portfolio

This portfolio showcases hands-on cybersecurity projects across incident response, network attacks, traffic analysis, and security audits.

The projects demonstrate practical skills in:
- Network traffic analysis
- Incident detection and response
- Denial-of-service attack analysis
- TCP/IP protocol behavior
- Risk assessment and internal security audits

## Portfolio Sections

### 1. Network Incident Response
Realistic investigations of network outages and service disruptions using packet captures and logs.

### 2. Network Attacks
Analysis of common network attacks such as TCP SYN flood denial-of-service attacks and their impact on servers.

### 3. Traffic Analysis
Deep dives into TCP and HTTP traffic using tools like Wireshark and tcpdump to distinguish normal vs abnormal behavior.

### 4. Internal Security Audits
Risk assessments and control evaluations using frameworks such as NIST CSF, RMF, and OWASP principles.

## Tools & Technologies
