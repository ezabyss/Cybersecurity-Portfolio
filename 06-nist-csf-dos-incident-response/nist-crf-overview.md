# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) – Overview

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) provides a structured approach for managing
cybersecurity risks.

## Five Core Functions

### Identify
Understand assets, risks, and vulnerabilities.

### Protect
Implement safeguards to prevent or limit the impact of attacks.

### Detect
Identify cybersecurity incidents quickly through monitoring and alerts.

### Respond
Contain, analyze, and mitigate incidents once detected.

### Recover
Restore systems and improve resilience after an incident.

## Why NIST CSF Matters
The CSF helps organizations respond consistently, communicate clearly with
stakeholders, and continuously improve security posture.
