# Vulnerability Assessment Report  
Publicly Exposed Database Server

---

## Summary

This vulnerability assessment evaluates the security risks associated with a publicly accessible database server used by an e-commerce organization. The server supports customer analytics, business intelligence, and revenue-generating operations. Because it has been exposed to the public internet since deployment, the system presents a high-risk attack surface. This assessment identifies key threat sources, evaluates potential threat events, and proposes actionable remediation strategies aligned with NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this assessment is to identify and evaluate risks affecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive business and customer data stored on the database server. This system is critical to daily operations, customer acquisition, and strategic decision-making. A compromise could result in data breaches, regulatory penalties, loss of customer trust, and operational downtime. Conducting this analysis enables stakeholders to understand risk exposure and prioritize security investments that protect business continuity.

## System Description and Scope

The system under review is a remote database server accessed by employees working from multiple geographic locations. The database has been publicly reachable since the company’s launch, allowing unrestricted network access. Employees regularly query the server to analyze customer data and identify potential customers.

The scope of this assessment is limited to risks impacting data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Physical security controls and unrelated internal IT systems are excluded from scope.

## Risk Assessment

### Threat Sources Identified

1. External attackers targeting publicly exposed infrastructure  
2. Malicious insiders or compromised employee credentials  
3. Automated bots conducting internet-wide scanning and exploitation  

---

### Threat Events Identified

1. Unauthorized access to sensitive customer and business data  
2. Data exfiltration or unauthorized modification using valid credentials  
3. Denial-of-service attacks disrupting database availability

## Assessment Approach

This assessment applies a qualitative risk analysis methodology based on NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1. Threat sources and events were selected based on the system’s public exposure, remote workforce model, and lack of network access controls. Publicly accessible databases are frequently targeted by attackers and automated scanning tools. Insider threats were also considered due to the reliance on credential-based authentication. These risks represent realistic and high-impact threats to business operations.

---

## Remediation and Mitigation Strategy

Immediate remediation should include removing public access to the database server through firewalls, network segmentation, and VPN-restricted access. Role-based access control should be implemented to enforce the principle of least privilege. Multi-factor authentication must be required for all privileged and remote access accounts. Sensitive data should be encrypted both in transit and at rest. Centralized logging, auditing, and continuous monitoring should be enabled to support detection and incident response.

## Reflection

This assessment demonstrates how basic security misconfigurations, such as public exposure of critical infrastructure, can significantly elevate organizational risk. Applying structured risk analysis and layered security controls enables organizations to reduce attack surface and improve resilience. This project reflects practical vulnerability assessment skills, industry-aligned reasoning, and documentation standards expected of entry-level cybersecurity professionals.
