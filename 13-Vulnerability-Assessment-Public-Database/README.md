# Vulnerability Assessment: Public Database Server Risk Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project documents a **qualitative vulnerability assessment** conducted for a small e-commerce business with a publicly accessible database server. The assessment evaluates security risks, identifies realistic threat scenarios, and proposes remediation strategies aligned with **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1**.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical risk analysis skills, security reasoning, and the ability to communicate findings clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## 🧠 Scenario Summary
The organization operates a remote database server that stores customer and business data. Because employees work globally, the database has been publicly accessible since launch. This configuration significantly increases the system’s attack surface and exposes the business to data breaches, service disruption, and reputational damage.

As a newly hired cybersecurity analyst, I was tasked with evaluating the risks associated with this system and recommending actionable security improvements.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze risks associated with a publicly accessible database server  
- Identify realistic **threat sources** and **threat events**  
- Calculate qualitative **risk scores** using likelihood and severity  
- Propose **practical remediation and mitigation strategies**  
- Align findings with **industry standards (NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1)**  

---

## 🔍 Assessment Scope
**In scope:**
- Confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of database data  
- Network exposure, access controls, authentication, and authorization  

**Out of scope:**
- Physical security  
- Unrelated internal IT systems  

---

## ⚠️ Key Risks Identified
- External attackers exploiting public exposure to exfiltrate sensitive data  
- Insider misuse or accidental data exposure due to weak access controls  
- Service disruption caused by denial-of-service or destructive tampering  

Each risk was evaluated using a qualitative risk model:  
**Risk = Likelihood × Severity**

## 🛠️ Remediation Highlights
- Remove public access using firewalls, VPNs, and IP allow-listing  
- Enforce the **principle of least privilege** with role-based access control (RBAC)  
- Require **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for all privileged access  
- Encrypt sensitive data both **in transit and at rest**  
- Enable centralized logging, auditing, and monitoring for anomaly detection
