# NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 — Risk Assessment Reference Guide

## Overview
**NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1** is a risk assessment framework published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It provides structured guidance for identifying, analyzing, and managing cybersecurity risks by evaluating **threat sources**, **threat events**, **likelihood**, and **impact**.

This guide is widely used by organizations to:
- Understand security risks to information systems
- Prioritize remediation efforts
- Allocate security resources effectively
- Support informed decision-making by leadership

> This reference is adapted for **practical cybersecurity assessments**, especially for small-to-medium organizations.

## Purpose of Risk Assessments
A risk assessment helps answer three critical questions:
1. **What can go wrong?** (Threats & vulnerabilities)
2. **How likely is it?** (Likelihood)
3. **How bad would it be?** (Severity / Impact)

Risk assessments connect **technical security findings** to **business impact**, making them valuable for both engineers and non-technical stakeholders.

## Threat Sources

NIST defines **threat sources** as entities or circumstances capable of exploiting vulnerabilities and causing harm.

### Human Threat Sources
| Type | Examples | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Standard User | Employee, Customer | May accidentally or intentionally misuse access |
| Privileged User | System Administrator | High access increases potential impact |
| Group | Competitor, Supplier, Nation-state | Organized threats with specific goals |
| Outsider | Hacker, Hacktivist, APT | External actors targeting systems |

> These threats often involve **intentional actions**, such as data theft, misuse of access, or sabotage.

---

### Technological Threat Sources
| Category | Examples | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Hardware | Storage, Processing, Network devices | Failures due to aging or malfunction |
| Software | OS, Networking, Malware | Bugs, misconfigurations, or malicious code |

> These threats usually arise from **system weaknesses** or poor maintenance.

---

### Environmental Threat Sources
| Category | Examples | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Operational Environment | Power supplies, temperature control | Accidental failures |
| Natural Hazards | Power outages, extreme weather | Non-human disruptions |

> These threats affect **availability** more than confidentiality.

---

## Threat Events

**Threat events** are actual actions where a threat source exploits a vulnerability.

### Common Threat Events (NIST SP 800-30 Examples)
| Threat Event | Description |
|---|---|
| Reconnaissance & Surveillance | Attackers scan systems to identify weaknesses |
| Data Exfiltration | Sensitive data is stolen from systems |
| Alter/Delete Data | Critical business data is modified or destroyed |
| DoS Attacks | System overwhelmed to disrupt operations |
| Man-in-the-Middle | Communications intercepted and altered |
| Obfuscation | Logs or alerts disabled to hide activity |
| Persistent Sniffers | Long-term monitoring of network traffic |
| Certificate Forgery | Trust infrastructure compromised |

---

## Likelihood Scoring (Qualitative → Quantitative)

Likelihood measures **how probable** a threat event is.

| Qualitative | Score | Description |
|---|---|---|
| High | 3 | Almost certain to occur; severe or catastrophic impact |
| Moderate | 2 | Possible; noticeable disruption |
| Low | 1 | Unlikely; minimal impact |

Likelihood considers:
- Threat actor capability
- Exposure level
- Historical evidence
- System configuration

---

## Severity (Impact) Scoring

Severity measures **business impact** if the event occurs.

| Qualitative | Score | Description |
|---|---|---|
| High | 3 | Business operations could stop entirely |
| Moderate | 2 | Major disruption or degraded performance |
| Low | 1 | Minor or negligible effects |

Severity is evaluated using the **CIA Triad**:
- **Confidentiality** — Data exposure
- **Integrity** — Data manipulation
- **Availability** — System downtime

---

## Risk Calculation Formula
> Risk Score = Likelihood × Severity


| Risk Score | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| 7–9 | High Risk — Immediate action required |
| 4–6 | Moderate Risk — Mitigation recommended |
| 1–3 | Low Risk — Monitor and review |

---

## Example Risk Assessment Table

| Threat Source | Threat Event | Likelihood | Severity | Risk | CIA Impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| External Hacker | Data exfiltration | 3 | 3 | 9 | C, I |
| Privileged User | Alter/Delete data | 2 | 3 | 6 | I, A |
| Environmental | Power outage | 1 | 3 | 3 | A |

## Why NIST SP 800-30 Matters
- Industry-recognized standard
- Vendor-neutral
- Aligns security with business impact
- Used in SOCs, audits, and compliance work
- Strong signal to recruiters of **real-world security knowledge**
