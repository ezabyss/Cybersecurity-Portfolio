# Security Recommendations

## To protect them I must do these things:

## High & Confidential Sensitivity Assets
- Change default credentials on all network devices
- Enable automatic firmware and OS updates
- Restrict administrative access
- Segment IoT devices where possible

## Restricted Assets
- Encrypt external storage devices
- Avoid sharing storage media without scanning for malware
- Maintain secure backups

## Internal-only Assets
- Use strong Wi-Fi encryption (WPA3)
- Monitor connected devices regularly
- Remove unused or unknown devices from the network

## Conclusion
Applying security controls based on asset sensitivity reduces exposure and improves the overall security posture of the home network. These controls reflect industry-standard risk-based security practices.
