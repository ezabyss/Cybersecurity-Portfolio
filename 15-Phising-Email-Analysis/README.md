# Spear Phishing Email Investigation – Executive Targeting

## 📌 Project Overview
This project documents a real-world **spear phishing investigation** involving a suspicious email sent to an executive at a fictional financial institution, *Imaginary Bank*. The email impersonates a trusted internal source and attempts to trick the recipient into installing unauthorized collaboration software.

The objective of this investigation is to identify phishing indicators, assess organizational risk, and determine whether the email should be **allowed or quarantined**.

---

## 🧠 Scenario Summary
An executive at Imaginary Bank received an unexpected email claiming they were added to a new executive collaboration group. The message requested immediate installation of a tool called **ExecuTalk**, despite no prior mention during official board meetings.

Due to concerns about legitimacy, the email was forwarded to the security team for analysis.

## 🔍 Investigation Scope
This project focuses on:

- Email header analysis  
- Social engineering and phishing indicators  
- Malicious link and domain analysis  
- Risk assessment for executive-targeted attacks  
- Final security decision and remediation recommendations  

---

## 🧪 Key Findings
- The sender used a **personal email domain** instead of an official corporate domain  
- The message contained **spelling and grammar errors** inconsistent with executive communications  
- Urgency and authority were used to manipulate the recipient
