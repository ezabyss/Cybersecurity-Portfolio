# Parking Lot USB Risk Assessment

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a security risk assessment based on a common real-world scenario known as a **USB baiting attack**. The assessment evaluates the risks associated with discovering an unknown USB drive in a public parking lot and analyzes the situation from both an attacker and defender perspective.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical security thinking, including identifying attack vectors, assessing risk, and proposing realistic mitigation strategies.
