## Network Hardening Tasks, Uses, and Risk Priority

| Security Hardening Task | Description | Common Uses | Risk Priority |
|-------------------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Baseline configurations | A documented and approved set of secure system specifications used as a reference point for future builds, releases, and updates. | Restores systems to a known secure state after outages, incidents, or unauthorized changes. | Medium |
| Configuration checks | Reviewing system and application settings, including encryption configurations, to verify compliance with security standards. | Detects unauthorized or insecure configuration changes. | High |
| Disabling unused ports | Blocking unnecessary or unused ports on firewalls, routers, servers, and network devices. | Prevents attackers from exploiting open or unnecessary ports. | High |
| Encryption using the latest standards | Protecting outgoing and incoming data using modern, approved encryption methods. | Protects sensitive data and is updated when standards change or after breaches. | High |
| Firewall maintenance | Regular review, tuning, and updating of firewall rules and configurations. | Blocks abnormal traffic and helps defend against DoS and DDoS attacks. | High |
| Hardware & software disposal | Securely wiping and decommissioning outdated or unused hardware and software. | Prevents exploitation of unsupported or unpatched systems. | Medium |
| Multifactor authentication (MFA) | Authentication requiring two or more verification factors such as passwords, tokens, or biometrics. | Protects against brute force and credential-based attacks. | High |
| Network access privileges | Controlled assignment of access permissions based on roles, users, or devices. | Limits unauthorized access and reduces the impact of compromised accounts. | High |
| Network log analysis | Systematic examination of network logs to identify suspicious or abnormal activity. | Enables early detection and investigation of security incidents. | High |
| Password policies | Standards for password creation and storage, including salting and hashing per NIST guidance. | Prevents password guessing and brute force attacks. | High |
| Patch updates | Software and operating system updates that remediate known vulnerabilities. | Reduces exposure to publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. | High |
| Penetration testing (Pen test) | Authorized simulated attacks used to identify system and network weaknesses. | Identifies vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them. | Medium |
| Port filtering | Firewall functionality that allows or blocks traffic based on port numbers. | Controls traffic flow and prevents unauthorized communication. | High |
| Removing or disabling unused applications and services | Eliminating unnecessary applications and services that introduce vulnerabilities. | Reduces attack surface and exposure to unmaintained software. | Medium |
| Server and data storage backups | Regularly maintained copies of critical data stored securely. | Enables recovery after attacks, failures, or accidental data loss. | Medium |
