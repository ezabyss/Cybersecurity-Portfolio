# Network Hardening Security Risk Assessment

## Overview
This project documents a security risk assessment for a social media organization that experienced a major data breach. It identifies key vulnerabilities and recommends network hardening tools and methods to reduce the likelihood of future breaches.

## Scenario (Provided)
A data breach exposed customer personal information (e.g., names and addresses). A network review identified these vulnerabilities:
- Employees share passwords
- Database admin password is set to the default
- Firewalls lack traffic filtering rules
- MFA is not used

## Deliverables
- `security-risk-assessment.md` — completed risk assessment
- `network-hardening-tools.xlsx` — supporting hardening tools worksheet (course artifact)

## Tools & Methods Highlighted
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Strong password policies (no sharing, lockouts, complexity)
- Firewall rule maintenance and traffic filtering

## Outcome
Recommended controls strengthen authentication, reduce credential-based attacks, and limit unnecessary network exposure, helping prevent future breaches.
